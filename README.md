# Challenge-4-Code-Quiz
The purpose of this website is to give the user a coding quiz that tests the user's knowledge.
The application has a fun, spooky horror theme that can be enjoyed by all.
Starting the quiz takes the user to an array of questions which the user must attempt to answer correctly in 60 seconds.
The quiz ends when the user answers all five questions or when they run out of time.
The user can then save their initials and final score to compare to previous attempts.
